# Hello-world
My first repository

Hi everybody, my name is Duc Duong and it is my very first time I come here, the github. 
Now I am 27 years old and I want to become a researcher about Photonics. 
Photonics is a large research about the light, and it contains some smaller parts, which are the Optics/Photonics, Optical Information Processing, guided-wave optics, Laser (photonic source), Optoelectronics, Photonic Devices and Fiber-Optic Communications. 
The term photonics is used broadly to encompass all of the aforementioned areas, including the following 
  - The generation of coherent light by lasers, and incoherent light by luminescence sources such as light-emitting diodes
  - The trasmission of light in free space, through conventional optical components such as lens, apertures, and imaging systems, and thorugh waveguides such as optical fibers. 
  - The modulation, swithching, and scanning of light by the use of electrically, acoustically, or optically controlled devices. 
  - The amplication and frequency conversion of light by the use of wave interactions in nonlinear materials 
  - The detection of light. 
  
In the git-hub, I want to show my self-project, which I did and will do in term of the photonic systems.
